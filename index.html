            "I'm on track to graduate from Kean University in May as an aspiring
            software engineer, with previous experience in the retail industry.
            During my time in retail, I've developed strong skills in
            problem-solving, customer service, and adaptability. Additionally, I
            worked as a product trainer for the first version of Apple Vision
            Pro. Meanwhile, at Kean, I focused on improving my programming
            abilities, understanding data structures better, and mastering the
            software development process."
