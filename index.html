              At Apple Inc., I've sharpened my technical skills and stayed on
              top of emerging trends, ensuring that I'm not just following the
              technology industry, but actively engaging with it. My previous
              roles at Best Buy have equipped me with a robust understanding of
              technical diagnostics and problem-solving, reinforcing my ability
              to understand and apply complex technical concepts.
